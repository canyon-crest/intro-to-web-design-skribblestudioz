      <p>I have too many side quests. Creating music is a big one, although so far I've only explored digital music composition (what I hope to get into) a bit, while the majority of music-making has been through piano. I also love drawing! I have zero experience but have basically been spending all my free time on it, so hopefully I'll improve? If <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/starduststudios" target="_blank">listening to music</a> counts as a hobby, then it's probably my biggest‚Ä¶ I listen to <span class="underline"> five hours of music on average</span>, especially Vocaloid. Apart from the above, I also like writing, ice skating, and closing doors.</p>

            <p>Did I mention I really like Vocaloid music? I tend not to listen to lyrical music and used to only prefer orchestral / instrumental, but Vocaloid voices have the redeeming quality of being vocal synths, meaning they're basically also instruments. Also, the genre is so vast that you can find music in<span class="underline"> just about every genre and just about every topic</span>. There is a song in my playlist about simply the singer's<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pgfr75lgro" target="_blank"> bread burning to a crisp</a> . As of writing this, my favorite work is probably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y808S-awM2E" target="_blank">Let's Go to Heaven</a> by Kikuo, but my all-time favorite creator is most definitely Inabakumori, who has composed amazing songs such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRQRC_0ZQ00" target="_blank">Float Play</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeKLpgzh-qQ" target="_blank">Lost Umbrella</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJN0piNZhBE" target="_blank">Hadal Abyss Zone.</a></p>
